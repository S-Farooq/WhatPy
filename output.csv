I'll be honest, I didn't have as much time to reflect on them as I did last time, but I think the questions this time were less open to interpretation and more concrete, so hopefully I didn't screw up too bad. I'm too tired to think at this time of night and didn't proof read either. Wrote the reply on my phone. I just know that I can't make excuses for not doing it. May Allah except my efforts, and jazak Allah Khair for taking the time to come up with discussion questions to help solidify the concepts of the book. :)"

12/14/15,4:23 PM,Shamil Khan,Tru
12/14/15,4:23 PM,Shamil Khan,"First, it is a responsibility upon a Muslim to differentiate truth from falsehood, falsehood being matters of bid'ah in this particular case of the mawlid. Your religion and my religion is in accordance to what has been ordained upon us by Allah through his speech and through His Messenger, and the one who is a Muslim of course is not going to express disagreement to that fact. That being said, what is defined as ""the bigger picture"" really? And I mean anyone can label people as narrow minded but the fact of the matter is, bid'ah is a heavy matter and the bigger picture is that this Ummah needs to return to Islam upon evidence rather than a life upon desires. Do we accommodate for innovation under the label of fitting into a ""bigger picture""? Did not the Messenger differentiate truth from falsehood before changes came? The bigger picture begins with making clear obedience to Allah, not accommodating for rebellion against Allah. One can claim to love Allah and the messenger but the religion is not up to our whims and desires but rather upon evidence. So I personally will continue to do what is within my capacity to advocate the speech of those who are learned with the matters of the deen, aiding in making clear what is the truth and what is not.  ""Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire."" (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah. The rasool rejected bid'ah firmly, and will turn away from those who invented in the religion after him (as reported in other Sahih hadith). Perhaps, the bigger picture is to defer others and ourselves from the Fire of Allah together, placing between us the evidence of the Quran and the Sunnah."

12/23/15,10:47 PM,Shamil Khan,"Canada needs Harper. You know how I know? Because I'm well informed. We shouldn’t tax the rich, the rich are rich for a reason they worked really hard to be there, they deserve something for that. They shouldn’t have to make up for the gaps that the poor have left because they didn’t work hard. He’s been badgered for losing so many full time jobs, but him putting in part time jobs is better for the country, and corporations, and salah, we can pray on time now, we can spend time with our families, we can live in better ibadah.. People keep saying he's using scare tactics its because stuff is real. Our fresh water resources have been under attack by NAFTA for years, but you know who kept everyone at bay? Harper. You know what water does for us? Let's us live, we drink it, we shower with it, WE ARE IT. 70% or more of our body is made of water, Allah sent water down on this planet as nourishment and a blessing. We make wudhu with it, we have our own spring called Zam Zam, we make dua when it rains, we make dua as we drink it, we do ghusl with it, cleanliness is half of our faith. A vote against Harper is a vote against water and hair and I don’t want to live in a world like that. *mic drop*"

12/30/15,10:32 PM,Shamil Khan,We need a new group
12/30/15,10:32 PM,Belal Saleem,Let's start accepting applications from people
12/30/15,10:32 PM,Belal Saleem,"Mahmoud is too far and something always ends up happening with him, I guess it's difficult for him"

12/30/15,10:34 PM,Shaham,Trolls aren't loyal

12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shaham,That's an escape room btw
12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shaham,Except shaham and Shamil. Already know shaham is down for this. Shamil doesn't want to come
12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shaham,And idk about anyone else
12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shamil Khan,"It's not any one person, and its not any one instance. It's an unfortunate trend"
12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shaham,"A trend of disloyalty, fake enthusiasm, and lack of initiative, and selfishness for your social needs."
12/30/15,10:47 PM,Shaham,?
12/30/15,10:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,Ok i agree lack of initiative on my end
12/30/15,10:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,Ok

12/30/15,10:49 PM,Hammad Mirza,Need everyone else's input on that
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Hammad Mirza,Escape room is going to be like that paintball thing man. Overly expensive and plain not fun. Let's do something real.
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Hammad Mirza,"I was going to plan, but Shaham is right, if y'all aren't free tomorrow, no inputs please. Only people who can actually come tomorrow should be involved for this thing. We have had too many flops. Not talking about any one person. Just reiterating what Shaham said."
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,"So if you can for sure come tomorrow, then please be a part of the planning process."
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,Escape room is completely diff than paintball
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,Look it up
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Hammad Mirza,No I mean it's going to be like that paintball experience we had.
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,Only reason we didn't completely hate it was because all of us were together.
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,There should be so many things we can do tomorrow. I'm not shooting down escape room idea btw.
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,"If everyone else is down, I'm down."
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,I'm down for anything just seeing your loyal (you know who you are) faces is enough
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Huzaifa,I don't understand how paintball = escape room
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Shamil Khan,"Why not do something simple like eat, skate, go to islands for fireworks🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉"
12/30/15,10:49 PM,Huzaifa,Huzaifa you're not invited omg
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Hammad Mirza,And paintball usually is fun. We just picked a really crappy venue
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Hammad Mirza,Who's down for evening fishing?
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Huzaifa,I like Huzaifas idea too
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Huzaifa,That's illegal without a license??
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Huzaifa,Crap I forgot my license doesn't exist any more
12/30/15,10:50 PM,Shamil Khan,🐤

12/30/15,10:55 PM,Shaham,If you aren't open to taking suggestions let us knpw
12/30/15,10:56 PM,Shaham,One thing for chilling out.
12/30/15,10:56 PM,Abdullah Ansari,No I'm open to suggestions
12/30/15,10:57 PM,Hammad Mirza,Escape roooooom
12/30/15,10:57 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Mine has all 3 :o
12/30/15,10:57 PM,Hammad Mirza,Hammad what exactly is an escape room
12/30/15,10:58 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Sounds boring
12/30/15,10:58 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Ok why are you shutting it down if you don't know what it is
12/30/15,10:58 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Should have asked earlier
12/30/15,10:58 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Basically you go with a group
12/30/15,10:58 PM,Hammad Mirza,It's a real life game thingy
12/30/15,11:36 PM,Shamil Khan,I didn't shut it down bro
12/30/15,11:37 PM,Shamil Khan,And you get stuck in a room for like an hour. And you have to solve some mystery and there are different clues in the room
12/30/15,11:37 PM,Shamil Khan,Oh
12/30/15,11:37 PM,Abdullah Ansari,And you work together
12/30/15,11:38 PM,Abdullah Ansari,What's the cost?

12/30/15,11:38 PM,Shamil Khan,Depenss
12/30/15,11:39 PM,Shamil Khan,Not as much as paintball
12/30/15,11:39 PM,Shamil Khan,And what kind of mystery?
12/30/15,11:49 PM,Belal Saleem,Because no equipment
12/30/15,11:50 PM,Hammad Mirza,Depends
12/30/15,11:50 PM,Huzaifa,Like clues and stuff?
12/30/15,11:51 PM,Shamil Khan,You look around the room for clues?
12/30/15,11:51 PM,Hammad Mirza,Some secret door?
12/30/15,11:51 PM,Shamil Khan,It depends lmao
12/30/15,11:51 PM,Hammad Mirza,But that's the gist of ot
12/30/15,11:51 PM,Huzaifa,Is it competing against other groups?

1/3/16,12:44 AM,Mahmoud (NN),Oh okay
1/3/16,12:45 AM,Qasim Malik,Mahmoud it is 10 bucks right now.
1/3/16,12:45 AM,Shamil Khan,I'd recommend against Java and C++ because you won't be building anything with them right away. It is just knowledge waiting to escape your brain.
1/3/16,12:46 AM,Shamil Khan,Only learn java and c++ if you have a clear roadmap of where you want to use them.
1/3/16,12:46 AM,Shamil Khan,Not to get an introduction to programming.

1/3/16,12:46 AM,Shamil Khan,I say start c++ just to get the fundamentals of programming since you haven't programmed yet
1/3/16,12:46 AM,Shamil Khan,But yeah shamils right by saying that you can't make anything with C++ and java
1/3/16,12:47 AM,Abdullah Ansari,"Hammad, I think Mahmoud needs instant gratification"
1/3/16,12:47 AM,Abdullah Ansari,Can't.make anything right away*

1/3/16,12:47 AM,Mahmoud (NN),And he can figure out what he likes and doesn't.
1/3/16,12:47 AM,Shamil Khan,Mahmoud man. You're saying that now.
1/3/16,12:47 AM,Mahmoud (NN),Remember the whole phone dilemma?
1/3/16,12:47 AM,Shamil Khan,C++ is pretty easy and straight forward and he'll understand how programming actuslly works before trying to make something
1/3/16,12:48 AM,Shamil Khan,It took you a year to decide. :(
1/3/16,12:48 AM,Shamil Khan,Well you have both options Mahmoud buddy. Hammad also has a fair point.
1/3/16,12:48 AM,Mahmoud (NN),:((((((
1/3/16,12:48 AM,Shamil Khan,"I say if you want that instant gratification, do what shamils saying. If you wanna learn a bit more then do some c++ first"
1/3/16,12:48 AM,Mahmoud (NN),Because you can't make anything right away with C++ but you can with Shamils way
1/3/16,12:49 AM,Hammad Mirza,"I would personally recommend you finish that course to get a feel for it. It'd an easier thing. You don't need any special IDEs, no compilers, no nothing. Someone is literally holding your hand guiding you. It will help you stick with it."
1/3/16,12:49 AM,Hammad Mirza,It's an easier appeal to human nature.
1/3/16,12:49 AM,Mahmoud (NN),It's like going to go the gym.

1/3/16,12:50 AM,Shamil Khan,I just think it's easier if you're really new.
1/3/16,12:50 AM,Shamil Khan,Okay so what languages does it teach?
1/3/16,12:50 AM,Shamil Khan,To to Udemy

1/3/16,12:53 AM,Hammad Mirza,"Just get introduced to any programming language. The logic is often very similar, all you have to do is pick up the syntax. Learning a programming language gets easier once you know one or two"
1/3/16,12:54 AM,Hammad Mirza,"But Mahmoud bro, you'll never learn if you keep talking about it"

1/6/16,11:24 PM,Hammad Mirza,Very interesting post by Abu Esa.
1/6/16,11:24 PM,Shamil Khan,"The number of Muslims who don't stay in their lane, speaking about things they are not qualified on, or ready for, is growing fast; it's like a viral breakout, a disease which has become endemic amongst us. Social media really has become a fitnah for them. It gave a platform to those who should not be on it. Perhaps they were saved from clubbing or dating or doing drugs etc, and instead started ""practising"" only to become addicted to another drug which is even worse: speaking without knowledge, ""educating"" without being educated, ""warning"" when ignorant, typing because they simply can, and so on. Once one is bitten by the bug of fame and attention, it is near impossible to go back. You think you can start talking about usul because of a few classes you take, and you think you can talk about bid'ah because you can pronounce the letter 'ayn - in fact, they always seem to have a great letter 'ayn, right? - and you think you can teach when you are wholly ignorant of the Shari'ah, and you think you can try and explain matters when you don't even know the Arabic language, let alone all the sciences that follow. Is this status about YOU? Yes it is. I don't need to mention one name as a flag-bearer of this disease when I aiming this at 50 of you who try and do the same but at varying levels of success. If you're thinking ""it's me he's talking about"", then you'd be right. If you're feeling paranoid right now, you should be. Because I *am* talking about you. Yes I've read your statements. Yes I also have a personal account on social media too and see and read what everyone else is talking about on my friends and liked lists. You shouldn't have gone there in the first place. This is what happens. If you rise like a balloon, full of gas, then expect someone to pop you when you talk nonsense or try to come across as someone you're not and mislead people. Is that me judging you? Sure thing. Hatin' on you? Absolutely. Forcing you to only stick to what you're good at. Correct. You wanted to give da'wah? Your keeping silent for a good few years will be the best da'wah you will ever give. You want to be an activist? Get off FB and actually get active and help someone. We don't need any more heroes online. The world doesn't need you. Believe me, it doesn't. Your style isn't so new, and your approach isn't so unique so as to justify the masses being exposed to an ignoramus. There is a huge difference between sharing content from qualified people and reminding folks that way - a great and encouraged thing - and you trying to do reminding from your own pocket and not knowing what you're talking about. And sometimes, you *will* know what you're talking about, but you should remain silent. Just to learn the system. Just to learn the skill of patience and humility. It will serve you well later when it is time for you to lead. I studied for nearly seven years - that's full time, not part time classes, and that's proper studying, not ""practising"" and living as a Muslim - before my teacher told me to go public with da'wah. My mouth and my fingers were quiet during that time. I studied for another seven before I had the belief and support from my teachers that I should have an opinion that is worth listening to. It's taken me another five years to realise that opinion isn't worth much at all, wa Allahu'l-Musta'an. Son, just stay in your lane. Please. For your own sake."
1/6/16,11:24 PM,Hammad Mirza,"Woah, he went offff"
1/6/16,11:24 PM,Shaham,"I completely agree with him. Not because I have felt that this group needs to be addressed. But because if he had ""gone easy"" he would have risked describing a much broader group."
1/6/16,11:24 PM,Shaham,He is very specific in terms of who he is addressing

1/10/16,11:41 AM,Shamil Khan,You build muscle by breaking down muscle tissue. Lower weights and higher reps train your muscular system.
1/10/16,11:41 AM,Shamil Khan,Higher weights and lower reps train your nervous system and allow you to basically make your muscles denser.
1/10/16,11:42 AM,Mahmoud (NN),"Those bodybuilders and people that just look good aesthetically, train with lower weights. :)"
1/10/16,11:42 AM,Shamil Khan,"That being said, you will increase your weights regardless in the first few months. It will feel amazing buddy."

1/13/16,9:03 PM,Shaham,Lots of organic chem
1/13/16,9:03 PM,Shaham,"From what he's seen of chemical, he'd hate having to work on contracts in random places without family, he doesn't really want the pharmaceutical Industry either"
1/13/16,9:04 PM,Hammad Mirza,Mech has a lot of math
1/13/16,9:04 PM,Hammad Mirza,Physics

1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,What was yours?
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,I want others to say too
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Abdullah Ansari,And then I have a follow up
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,I thought it meant you should easily adjust to the environment around you
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,Water takes the shape of its container = we easily adjust to surroundings
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Shamil Khan,Okay sweet
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,That's what I was thinking Hammad
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Shamil Khan,"What does adjustment mean to you? Would you say its assimilating or accommodating? The different being assimilate mean u change urself to match surrounding (ex.start becoming very math in engineering), accommodating meaning don't change urself but try and fit the environment with relation to you already are (focus on the what ur good at in engineering and just do the minimal math)?"
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Abdullah Ansari,Very good in math*
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Hammad Mirza,water = pure
1/14/16,3:48 PM,Shamil Khan,transparent

1/14/16,4:12 PM,Mahmoud (NN),Be adhesive ;)
1/14/16,4:11 PM,Mahmoud (NN),"Be easy on people, flow smoothly"
1/14/16,4:12 PM,Mahmoud (NN),Agree with shamil
1/14/16,4:33 PM,Shamil Khan,And shaham made a good distinction between assimilating and accommodation
1/14/16,4:33 PM,Shamil Khan,"The saying be like water's traditional meaning is be adaptable (simplifying here) however, thats not the only lesson you can take from it"
1/14/16,4:33 PM,Shamil Khan,There is always more then one lesson in something
1/14/16,4:33 PM,Shamil Khan,"Better to accommodate, you should never give up something in your nature to fit in better with the surroundings, it's a fine line and easily to overstep it but I feel it's really important"
1/14/16,4:39 PM,Shaham,"Mainly though, anything that comes to you is only what you take from it, which I'm pretty sure we all know, but it means that people also attach different meanings to stuff unless they decide to run with the status quo"
1/14/16,4:39 PM,Shaham,People always attach definite meanings to things whereas I think things are rarely definite in this world
1/14/16,4:39 PM,Shaham,"Its all perception and perspective, but the main thing is you should always take away something positive from every experience"
1/14/16,4:40 PM,Shaham,We are a product of what we surround ourselves with. We shape into whichever shape the container is.
1/14/16,4:44 PM,Shaham,"Like a sponge, we absorb and we become"

1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,very interesting read
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,"Why does the author keep saying ""moslems"""
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,"Apart from that, like you said, very interesting read"
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Hammad Mirza,Yeah no idea why lol
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,Maybe it's targeted towards a certain audience
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,'Muricans
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,Wow I've never thought of this stuff on terms of relativity
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,It's very cool
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shaham,I know right
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,I just assumed the 1 day in hereafter = however many days on earth as something that can be passed off as something we have no knowledge of
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Hammad Mirza,Pretty cool
1/17/16,10:55 PM,Shamil Khan,People usually think that science and Islam can't be correlated but it can
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,But what do us moslems know
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,SubhanAllah
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,"But yo, I didn't know wormholes actually exist lol"
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,Thought they were fictional
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,Its a theory
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Hammad Mirza,They may not
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,But there is sufficient scientific fact to suggest it's possible
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,I see
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Hammad Mirza,Interesting read but I'm pretty against discussions like this
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,This makes a huge assumption that rules of the universe will be continued
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,Eternal places theologically are above the universe. The entire universe is a single sky
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,"And when God says he will roll up everything until only He is left and then recreate, some interpret that as a new construction of physics (as we know it)"
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,Science and Islam can of course be correlated but things like this are artificial pushing trying to make it make sense.
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,Good point
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Hammad Mirza,"Yeah, in the end, Allah hu alam"
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,Still a pretty cool observation
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,No way we can know if earth's laws extend to the heavens
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,"I agree with Shaham exactly. We shouldn't try and make Islam conform to science, but we should also keep our minds open to marvel at the creations of Allah. Science isn't constant. Islam is!"
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shamil Khan,"Ye its still is just a matter of perspective and interpretation, trying to fit the pieces together"
1/17/16,10:56 PM,Shaham,Guys how do you download audio on to nexus from YouTube

1/30/16,3:20 PM,Shaham,Wasn't working for me
1/30/16,3:21 PM,Mahmoud (NN),Like a network error happens
1/30/16,3:21 PM,Mahmoud (NN),So it assumes the verse is continuous
1/30/16,3:21 PM,Hammad Mirza,With no breaks.
1/30/16,3:22 PM,Mahmoud (NN),I've tried it twice now

1/31/16,10:06 PM,Hammad Mirza,No I told him to do a surah

1/31/16,10:09 PM,Hammad Mirza,Pretty cool. Thought of this before
1/31/16,10:09 PM,Belal Saleem,But doest it recognize voices from a computer?
1/31/16,10:09 PM,Hammad Mirza,Or just if you recite in front of it?
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Hammad Mirza,Didn't try a comp
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Belal Saleem,But I don't see why it wouldn't
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Hammad Mirza,If the volume is pretty loud it should work
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Hammad Mirza,"Nah, cause Google voice input doesn't take sounds from a computer or speaker."
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Belal Saleem,"So if they used googles apk, then it wont take sounds from a computer"
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Belal Saleem,"Qasim, it could take input from computer too"
1/31/16,10:10 PM,Hammad Mirza,"Hammad, remember when we used Google on the computer?"

1/31/16,10:13 PM,Shamil Khan,I think the problem is.how.clear the audio is from the comp
1/31/16,10:13 PM,Hammad Mirza,It's usually not high def audio if you're playing from YouTube so itll have trouble.picking it up

2/14/16,8:59 PM,Shaham,If I understood it why would I be cheesed
2/14/16,8:59 PM,Hammad Mirza,Guys lets bury the hatchet.
2/14/16,8:59 PM,Hammad Mirza,"For some things you have to say ""I don't understand but imma let it go because I understand it means something to them. Idk what it means but it means something so ima let it go and let it be"""
2/14/16,8:59 PM,Shaham,"You're like, victimizing me qasim"
2/14/16,8:59 PM,Shamil Khan,And I disagree that basketball games are something I can feel that towards
2/14/16,8:59 PM,Shamil Khan,Making it look like we're horrible people
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shaham,That's not called victimizing
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shamil Khan,For watching an important game vs chilling with you
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shaham,I'm definitely not making u victims
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shamil Khan,Sorry not victimizing

2/14/16,9:00 PM,Hammad Mirza,That's the whole beef.
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shaham,Which I don't think is cool
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Belal Saleem,Not saying ur horrible people
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shaham,I'm saying I think that's as a mean thing to do
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Belal Saleem,Absolutely... I mean why else would I be cheesed
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Shaham,Was a mean*
2/14/16,9:00 PM,Hammad Mirza,U want me to be mad about all of it but still think you guys did the best thing?
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,And also its not just 'chillong' with me
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Hammad Mirza,U say I don't understand hype
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Hammad Mirza,But u don't seem to be understanding I was leaving for a year so yeah I was kinda feeling more than just 'wanting to chill'
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,Was this the day before you left?
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,Literally
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,The day.
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,Before.
2/14/16,9:01 PM,Shaham,I left.
2/14/16,9:02 PM,Shaham,But that was to pak
2/14/16,9:07 PM,Hammad Mirza,The game was in April
2/14/16,9:07 PM,Huzaifa,For 3 months and then from there
2/14/16,9:07 PM,Hammad Mirza,To Cali
2/14/16,9:08 PM,Shamil Khan,I reached back for 2 days
2/14/16,9:08 PM,Shamil Khan,But that's besides the point
2/14/16,9:09 PM,Shaham,"Cause like I said, to me, I was leaving."
2/14/16,9:09 PM,Shaham,I don't remember what happened that day but not sure why we didn't chill before the game. That would've made sense to do
2/14/16,9:09 PM,Shaham,Yeah it would have
2/14/16,9:09 PM,Shaham,"I remember, to me I knew you didn't like ball but thought it was fine that we were just at qasims house chilling while watching the game"
2/14/16,9:19 PM,Hammad Mirza,Seemed like a decent compromise
2/14/16,9:20 PM,Shaham,My bad for not seeing 2 years into the future and knowing you were pissed off the entire time
2/14/16,9:20 PM,Hammad Mirza,Dude I'm not pissed now
2/14/16,9:20 PM,Shaham,I was pissed then

2/14/16,9:21 PM,Shaham,I got rid of it
2/14/16,9:21 PM,Hammad Mirza,I just brought it up cause the big bball game reminded me
2/14/16,9:21 PM,Shaham,I'm not talking sides
2/14/16,9:21 PM,Shaham,All that led to was me developing a deep hatred for big bball games is all I was saying before you started arguing
2/14/16,9:21 PM,Hammad Mirza,"But to me, human interaction and involvement ie chilling with Ur guys wins over watching a sporting event"
2/14/16,9:21 PM,Shaham,And ima huge soccer basketball fan

2/14/16,9:24 PM,Shaham,"But anyways, no one knows the entire story, game ended at like 9:30, could have just chilled after but you left. Best thing to do would have been to do something before the game and after the game, I don't remember anything other than the game at the time"
2/14/16,9:24 PM,Hammad Mirza,Pakistani parliament is the first in the world to be solar powered.

2/14/16,9:25 PM,Hammad Mirza,Got pissed today because you made it sound like big games only get hyped up by unfaithful people.who get so engulfed in the hype that they forget everything about their lives and no one should ever get hyped about anything like a sporting event

2/14/16,9:28 PM,Shaham,I don't remember what I did before or after the game. I remember inpicked you up and took you to qasims house then you left
2/14/16,9:28 PM,Hammad Mirza,"I was pissed yes, and I still feel justified for that, and I feel I am right to be and no I don't understand your perspective. But now I'm not and its over but it has left me with a deep hatred for big games. But the fact I'm not pissed is not cause of you guys, its cause I chose to not be."
2/14/16,9:28 PM,Shaham,Is all my point.

2/14/16,10:19 PM,Shamil Khan,But they were up 4-1 so why not
2/14/16,10:19 PM,Shamil Khan,"I just read some (not all) of last nights back and forth ^ I wanna get serious for a sec cause it seemed like a serious convo. 1) Belal totally took sides. If he wanted to be neutral, he shouldn't have said anything. The point he made about friendship > sports was an  obvious one which Hammad clearly never disagreed with it to begin with. Nah I'm not calling you out Belal, you just didn't see what the conflict really was. 2) Shamil just kicked Hammad while he was down. That made Hammad even more defensive. 3) About us ditching you to watch a game, tbh I can't recall that night, but like Hammad said, it doesn't make sense to us why wouldn't have spent it with you considering it was your last night here. From what I remember, we did chill before you left. Having said that, I know I've pulled shit like this so I'm not shocked that this happened. I recognize the flaw, I just haven't been able to fix it. As for Hammad, I'm sure he feels bad about it, but I trust him enough to know it wasn't intentional. But Shaham, its totally understandable why you minded that, sounds real whack on our part. Maybe at the time we didn't realize what was happening, but I understand. I apologize for it and I'll try and make sure it doesn't happen again."
2/14/16,10:19 PM,Shamil Khan,I know y'all already moved on from this talk but I thought I'd say some. its not awkward at all to talk like this sometimes 🙃
