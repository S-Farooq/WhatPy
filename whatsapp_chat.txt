12/3/15, 3:40 AM - Shamil Khan: Shaham bro, I just finished the reading and answered the questions. I'll be honest, I didn't have as much time to reflect on them as I did last time, but I think the questions this time were less open to interpretation and more concrete, so hopefully I didn't screw up too bad. I'm too tired to think at this time of night and didn't proof read either. Wrote the reply on my phone. I just know that I can't make excuses for not doing it. May Allah except my efforts, and jazak Allah Khair for taking the time to come up with discussion questions to help solidify the concepts of the book. :)

12/3/15, 12:35 PM - Shaham: Shamil, there's no 'screwing' up bro, its for ur own understanding, to write things down. The questions are guidelines for you, all reflections are open ended, the questions are more prompts for you to start somewhere and mention some interesting things you read.
12/3/15, 12:36 PM - Shaham: Good job on writing it :) 👍🏼
12/3/15, 12:39 PM - Qasim Malik: Shamil, you inspire me

12/7/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Front the article: (talking about farhat hashmi)
12/7/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Farzana Hassan, a liberal Muslim who is on the board of directors with the Muslim Canadian Congress, recalls attending one of Hashmi’s lectures out of curiosity and said she heard a “very fundamentalist brand of Islam,” which includes condoning polygamy and the segregation of women, among other things.
12/7/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: “They just say that she is very knowledgeable and she is actually teaching the pure Islam. What they understand as the pure Islam is something very, very conservative and fundamentalist,” she said. “When you have that kind of Islam, it’s a package deal. It’s not just the wearing of the burka and the stoning to death for adultery…it’s also jihad.”
12/7/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: How is this woman on the Muslim congress
12/7/15, 11:55 PM - Hammad Mirza: Polygamy and segregation of woman --> being involved in terrorism
12/7/15, 11:55 PM - Hammad Mirza: Lol ok

12/8/15, 1:11 PM - Shamil Khan: Fyi he's not gay
12/8/15, 1:12 PM - Shamil Khan: He is an ardent fan of perfumes. He has a habit of saying the English word "men" all the time, and he calls Erza "my honey"

12/8/15, 1:13 PM - Shamil Khan: Loooool, he's so jokes man
12/8/15, 1:13 PM - Shamil Khan: Ichiya goes off alone and runs into a small group of thugs from one of the Dark Guilds allied with Oración Seis. Rather than fight, Ichiya cowardly begs for his life.[13] He is captured, tied to a pole, and carried off by the Dark Guild, all the while trying to bargain with the thugs to let him go.
12/8/15, 1:13 PM - Shamil Khan: Lol
12/8/15, 1:13 PM - Shaham: Through his behaviour, we understand the theme of fate and free will

12/14/15, 4:28 PM - Huzaifa: Tru
12/14/15, 4:42 PM - Abdullah Ansari: First, it is a responsibility upon a Muslim to differentiate truth from falsehood, falsehood being matters of bid'ah in this particular case of the mawlid. Your religion and my religion is in accordance to what has been ordained upon us by Allah through his speech and through His Messenger, and the one who is a Muslim of course is not going to express disagreement to that fact. That being said, what is defined as "the bigger picture" really? And I mean anyone can label people as narrow minded but the fact of the matter is, bid'ah is a heavy matter and the bigger picture is that this Ummah needs to return to Islam upon evidence rather than a life upon desires. Do we accommodate for innovation under the label of fitting into a "bigger picture"? Did not the Messenger differentiate truth from falsehood before changes came? The bigger picture begins with making clear obedience to Allah, not accommodating for rebellion against Allah. One can claim to love Allah and the messenger but the religion is not up to our whims and desires but rather upon evidence. So I personally will continue to do what is within my capacity to advocate the speech of those who are learned with the matters of the deen, aiding in making clear what is the truth and what is not. 

 "Every newly-invented thing is a bid'ah (innovation), every bid'ah is a going astray, and every going astray will be in the Fire." (Reported by al-Nisaa'i in al-Sunan, Salaat al-'Eedayn, Baab kayfa al-Khutbah). Reports with the same meaning were narrated via Jaabir (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ahmad, via al-'Irbaad ibn Saariyah by Abu Dawud and via Ibn Mas'ood (may Allaah be pleased with him) by Ibn Maajah.

The rasool rejected bid'ah firmly, and will turn away from those who invented in the religion after him (as reported in other Sahih hadith).

Perhaps, the bigger picture is to defer others and ourselves from the Fire of Allah together, placing between us the evidence of the Quran and the Sunnah.
12/14/15, 4:51 PM - Shaham: Thought your brain was dead bro

“The slave is not afflicted with a punishment greater than the hardening of the heart and being distant from Allah. For the Fire was created to melt the hardened heart. The most distant heart from Allah is the heart which is hardened. If the heart becomes hardened, the eye becomes dry.” 

Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim

12/23/15, 10:50 PM - Hammad Mirza: Mahmoud's speech:
12/23/15, 10:50 PM - Hammad Mirza: Canada needs Harper. You know how I know? Because I'm well informed. We shouldn’t tax the rich, the rich are rich for a reason they worked really hard to be there, they deserve something for that. They shouldn’t have to make up for the gaps that the poor have left because they didn’t work hard. He’s been badgered for losing so many full time jobs, but him putting in part time jobs is better for the country, and corporations, and salah, we can pray on time now, we can spend time with our families, we can live in better ibadah.. People keep saying he's using scare tactics its because stuff is real. Our fresh water resources have been under attack by NAFTA for years, but you know who kept everyone at bay? Harper. You know what water does for us? Let's us live, we drink it, we shower with it, WE ARE IT. 70% or more of our body is made of water, Allah sent water down on this planet as nourishment and a blessing. We make wudhu with it, we have our own spring called Zam Zam, we make dua when it rains, we make dua as we drink it, we do ghusl with it, cleanliness is half of our faith. A vote against Harper is a vote against water and hair and I don’t want to live in a world like that. *mic drop*
12/23/15, 10:50 PM - Shaham: Woww

12/28/15, 9:51 PM - Shamil Khan: Qasim can't direct message.
12/28/15, 9:51 PM - Shamil Khan: :/
12/28/15, 9:52 PM - Qasim Malik: Mahmoud my Allah increase you in goodness

12/28/15, 9:55 PM - Mahmoud (NN): Man 😭😭
12/28/15, 10:20 PM - Belal Saleem: I don't think kd is better then Curry but I still think lebron is better then Curry. However I can't disagree with anybody if they day Curry is better simply because of the numbers he is putting up
12/28/15, 10:20 PM - Belal Saleem: I would argue for lebron that the media always pushes for the player who seems to be at the top rn and that is Curry
12/28/15, 10:20 PM - Belal Saleem: Lebron is doing what Curry is doing rn for like 4 years
12/28/15, 10:21 PM - Belal Saleem: Also call me when Curry is the top scorer, rebounder defender, assisted for his team on a championship winning team with the best fg percentage as well
12/28/15, 10:22 PM - Qasim Malik: Shame on you
12/28/15, 10:24 PM - Huzaifa: 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫
12/28/15, 10:32 PM - Belal Saleem: Shame on you qasim for forgetting the last 5 years of basketball
12/28/15, 10:32 PM - Shamil Khan: Qasim got rekt tbh
12/28/15, 10:32 PM - Belal Saleem: Suffering from amnesia, that's what this media hype train has done to us
12/28/15, 10:32 PM - Shamil Khan: Nice job Belal
12/28/15, 10:32 PM - Shamil Khan: Qasim is on the curry bandwagon
12/28/15, 10:33 PM - Shamil Khan: It's about time you shoot the horses dead and make him walk the rest of the way.
12/28/15, 11:42 PM - Qasim Malik: Media hype? Lol nah bro, I just appreciate greatness when I see it. Night in and night out. Curry just scored 17 pts in 3 minutes. When's the last time Lebron did that? 2011? 2013? Yea Lebron was easily the best, but there's a new sheriff in town now and his name is Curry. Sooner you recognize that the better.
12/28/15, 11:42 PM - Qasim Malik: What curry is doing right now hasn't been done in the NBA.. Ever.
12/28/15, 11:43 PM - Shaham: All started when i visited him in San Fran, not saying anything but jus saying
12/28/15, 11:43 PM - Qasim Malik: Nah. It started before that. He just exploded last two years
12/28/15, 11:43 PM - Qasim Malik: All the work he put in really shows
12/28/15, 11:44 PM - Qasim Malik: It wasn't a sudden switch
12/28/15, 11:44 PM - Qasim Malik: He got better with years
12/28/15, 11:44 PM - Qasim Malik: I actually saw his greatness coming, but I never expected this type of greatness tbh
12/28/15, 11:45 PM - Shaham: you're right, but my face in the crowd gave him that extra push
12/28/15, 11:45 PM - Shaham: after i left that week, there wasn't a week where i didnt hear his name
12/28/15, 11:46 PM - Shaham: i guess it helps cause i didnt even know his name before...but still.
12/28/15, 11:46 PM - Qasim Malik: <Media omitted>
12/28/15, 11:47 PM - Huzaifa: Your idolizing some random light skin dude when you should be idolizing the prophet
12/28/15, 11:53 PM - Shaham: I think we should stop making those jokes.
12/28/15, 11:54 PM - Shaham: Serious note here, I know Qasim and I do it a lot
12/28/15, 11:56 PM - Shamil Khan: You're*
12/28/15, 11:56 PM - Shamil Khan: Huzaifa is a complete fob
12/28/15, 11:57 PM - Shaham: Yoo Shamil reccomend a movie
12/28/15, 11:58 PM - Shaham: Something you genuinely think I would like, not just what you like
12/28/15, 11:58 PM - Shaham: Not comedy
12/28/15, 11:58 PM - Shamil Khan: Have u seen antman?
12/28/15, 11:58 PM - Shamil Khan: Watch Antman
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shaham: Hmm but its superhero :(
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shaham: I don't like those that much
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shaham: Need something deep right now
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shamil Khan: Hmm
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shamil Khan: Martian?
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shamil Khan: I haven't seen it yet
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shamil Khan: But it's supposedly good
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - You changed the subject to “Wholeedays”
12/28/15, 11:59 PM - Shaham: Oh yah
12/29/15, 12:00 AM - Shaham: That one is highly recommended
12/29/15, 12:00 AM - Shamil Khan: Primewire.ag
12/29/15, 12:00 AM - Shamil Khan: :)))
12/29/15, 12:00 AM - Qasim Malik: Shaham, thanks for pointing that out
12/29/15, 12:01 AM - Qasim Malik: We should do more to improve our characters. If we find flaws in each other, we should advise. Something we already know, I know, but still.
12/29/15, 12:01 AM - Qasim Malik: 📈📈
12/29/15, 12:01 AM - Shamil Khan: Qasim you're flawed physically
12/29/15, 12:01 AM - Shaham: 👍🏼 iA that's what's helping each other out
12/29/15, 12:01 AM - Shamil Khan: Jk
12/29/15, 12:02 AM - Shaham: Shamil you are really annoying when you makes jokes during a relatively serious dialogue, that's also me trying to point something out.
12/29/15, 12:02 AM - Qasim Malik: Its never an attack, hope nobody finds it offensive. For example what Shaham just advised Huzaifa on. Its something I do a lot, I know I gotta improve it.
12/29/15, 12:02 AM - Shamil Khan: +1
12/29/15, 12:02 AM - Shaham: It's good you said jks but yeah don't take offense...just stop doing it :/
12/29/15, 12:02 AM - Shaham: :) ❤
12/29/15, 12:03 AM - Shamil Khan: ❤
12/29/15, 12:03 AM - Qasim Malik: If I get negative feedback, it'll help me rid that habit faster as oppose to us laughing it off, you know?
12/29/15, 12:03 AM - Qasim Malik: Random, sometimes I reread what I write and it doesn't even make sense to me 😂😂
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Qasim Malik: Hope y'all understood what I tried to say there
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Shaham: I got you man
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Shaham: Alhamdulillah, good for all of us
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Qasim Malik: A hint of seriousness is never a bad thing
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Qasim Malik: We play too much lmao
12/29/15, 12:04 AM - Qasim Malik: I****
12/29/15, 12:05 AM - Shaham: A lot of seriousness sometimes isn't bad either, I agree. We need a keep it light but not be afraid to get down and heavy sometimes
12/29/15, 12:05 AM - Qasim Malik: That's not moist talk btw, just saying what's on my mind 🔑

1) A man whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it righteously (in a just and right way according to what Allah has ordered) 

2) A man whom Allah has given Al-Hikmah (wisdom, knowledge of the Qur'an and the Sunnah) and be acts according to it and teaches it to others" [Sahih Al-Bukhari]

12/30/15, 10:32 PM - Shaham: U never reached out to me
12/30/15, 10:32 PM - Shaham: Guess it ain't just women that ain't loyal.

12/30/15, 10:33 PM - Shamil Khan: They ain't loyal bro
12/30/15, 10:33 PM - Shaham: No loyalty, no respect
12/30/15, 10:33 PM - Shamil Khan: Qasim only replies if you say his name.
12/30/15, 10:33 PM - Shamil Khan: And even then it takes ages.
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: You gotta initiate everything with Qasim

12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: He will message u
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shamil Khan: Gotta beg him
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: Initiating something
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: But its a hope in vain
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shamil Khan: He only messages when he wants something
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: It's just pain on pain man.
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shamil Khan: Or needs a favour
12/30/15, 10:34 PM - Shaham: Or when he wants discounts

12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shaham: Abdullah almost always flops these days
12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shamil Khan: Yep
12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shaham: And also only comes to give us some piece of 'knowledge'
12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shamil Khan: agreed
12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shamil Khan: We need a new group
12/30/15, 10:35 PM - Shamil Khan: Let's start accepting applications from people
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shaham: Mahmoud is too far and something always ends up happening with him, I guess it's difficult for him
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shaham: So I'll give him that
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shaham: Wallahi man gonna say it straight
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shaham: Shamil and Belal are the only ones loyal.
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shaham: Belal tries his best I see it
12/30/15, 10:36 PM - Shamil Khan: Yeah Mahmoud genuinely wants to chill, but things come up.

12/30/15, 10:38 PM - Hammad Mirza: And tbh I didn't plan anything I did this winter break
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Hammad Mirza: So whenever someone plans something, I go there 😶
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Hammad Mirza: No initiative on my end lolol
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Shamil Khan: Yeah yeah yeah, keep telling yourself that bro
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Huzaifa: I'm loyal wth
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Hammad Mirza: Ask abdullah. I didn't even want to go skating
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Shamil Khan: Huzaifa you're a troll
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Shamil Khan: Trolls aren't loyal
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Hammad Mirza: And it took a lot of convincing to get me to go to toronto
12/30/15, 10:39 PM - Hammad Mirza: And I went to raps game with Saad so that doesn't count
12/30/15, 10:40 PM - Shaham: Yo Hammad
12/30/15, 10:40 PM - Shaham: That's the worst response
12/30/15, 10:40 PM - Shaham: What ur saying is
12/30/15, 10:44 PM - Shaham: Its not just u, I don't give a shit about anyone
12/30/15, 10:44 PM - Shaham: Which doesn't make anyone feel better..Im not gonna compare myself to ur friends
12/30/15, 10:44 PM - Hammad Mirza: LMAO what I'm saying is its too much effort to plan something, as you said. But when someone plans something, I'm down
12/30/15, 10:44 PM - Shaham: Nah man
12/30/15, 10:44 PM - Shaham: Weak
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Hammad Mirza: Howwww
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: Ur saying u don't care enough to put in work
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: Even though you were away for 4 months
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: U just want others
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: To do things
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: For u
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Shaham: Which u can conveniently come too
12/30/15, 10:45 PM - Hammad Mirza: Yooo its not even about me. It's about a whole group
12/30/15, 10:46 PM - Hammad Mirza: If someone suggests something we can collaborate and plan it
12/30/15, 10:46 PM - Hammad Mirza: But going solo doesn't work
12/30/15, 10:46 PM - Hammad Mirza: Let's do the escape room thing then
12/30/15, 10:47 PM - Shamil Khan: Lol

12/30/15, 10:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: So what else can I do
12/30/15, 10:48 PM - Shamil Khan: Can't pin this on me bro :$
12/30/15, 10:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: Just saying you're the only one who responded

12/30/15, 10:49 PM - Huzaifa: Ok

12/30/15, 10:50 PM - Shamil Khan: Wow Hammad
12/30/15, 10:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: <Media omitted>
12/30/15, 10:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: I could ask right now what times work for people. But no ones going to respond
12/30/15, 10:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: That's an escape room btw
12/30/15, 10:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: Except shaham and Shamil. Already know shaham is down for this. Shamil doesn't want to come
12/30/15, 10:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: And idk about anyone else
12/30/15, 10:55 PM - Shaham: It's not any one person, and its not any one instance. It's an unfortunate trend
12/30/15, 10:56 PM - Shaham: A trend of disloyalty, fake enthusiasm, and lack of initiative, and selfishness for your social needs.
12/30/15, 10:56 PM - Abdullah Ansari: ?
12/30/15, 10:57 PM - Hammad Mirza: Ok i agree lack of initiative on my end
12/30/15, 10:57 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Ok
12/30/15, 10:57 PM - Hammad Mirza changed the subject to “WHO'S FREE WHEN”
12/30/15, 10:57 PM - Hammad Mirza: Abdullah shut up
12/30/15, 10:58 PM - Abdullah Ansari: I've been wanting to go to escape room
12/30/15, 10:58 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Since ever
12/30/15, 10:58 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Gimme a time
12/30/15, 10:58 PM - Abdullah Ansari: And date
12/30/15, 10:58 PM - Hammad Mirza: Need everyone else's input on that
12/30/15, 11:36 PM - Shamil Khan: Escape room is going to be like that paintball thing man. Overly expensive and plain not fun. Let's do something real.
12/30/15, 11:37 PM - Shamil Khan: I was going to plan, but Shaham is right, if y'all aren't free tomorrow, no inputs please. Only people who can actually come tomorrow should be involved for this thing. We have had too many flops. Not talking about any one person. Just reiterating what Shaham said.
12/30/15, 11:37 PM - Shamil Khan: So if you can for sure come tomorrow, then please be a part of the planning process.
12/30/15, 11:37 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Escape room is completely diff than paintball
12/30/15, 11:38 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Look it up
12/30/15, 11:38 PM - Shamil Khan: No I mean it's going to be like that paintball experience we had.
12/30/15, 11:38 PM - Shamil Khan: Only reason we didn't completely hate it was because all of us were together.
12/30/15, 11:39 PM - Shamil Khan: There should be so many things we can do tomorrow. I'm not shooting down escape room idea btw.
12/30/15, 11:39 PM - Shamil Khan: If everyone else is down, I'm down.
12/30/15, 11:49 PM - Belal Saleem: I'm down for anything just seeing your loyal (you know who you are) faces is enough
12/30/15, 11:50 PM - Hammad Mirza: I don't understand how paintball = escape room
12/30/15, 11:50 PM - Huzaifa: Why not do something simple like eat, skate, go to islands for fireworks🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉
12/30/15, 11:51 PM - Shamil Khan: Huzaifa you're not invited omg
12/30/15, 11:51 PM - Hammad Mirza: And paintball usually is fun. We just picked a really crappy venue
12/30/15, 11:51 PM - Shamil Khan: Who's down for evening fishing?
12/30/15, 11:51 PM - Hammad Mirza: I like Huzaifas idea too
12/30/15, 11:51 PM - Huzaifa: That's illegal without a license??
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: Crap I forgot my license doesn't exist any more
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Huzaifa: 🐤
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: Okay let's figure this out.
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: Shamil what are you planning anywyss
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: We need 3 things
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: We gotta eat
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: One thing for fun
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: If you aren't open to taking suggestions let us knpw
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: One thing for chilling out.
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Shamil Khan: No I'm open to suggestions
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Hammad Mirza: Escape roooooom
12/30/15, 11:52 PM - Huzaifa: Mine has all 3 :o
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Shamil Khan: Hammad what exactly is an escape room
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Huzaifa: Sounds boring
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: Ok why are you shutting it down if you don't know what it is
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: Should have asked earlier
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: Basically you go with a group
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Huzaifa: It's a real life game thingy
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Shamil Khan: I didn't shut it down bro
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: And you get stuck in a room for like an hour. And you have to solve some mystery and there are different clues in the room
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Shamil Khan: Oh
12/30/15, 11:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: And you work together
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: What's the cost?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: To solve the mystery
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Depenss
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Not as much as paintball
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: And what kind of mystery?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Because no equipment
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Depends
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Like clues and stuff?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: You look around the room for clues?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Some secret door?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: It depends lmao
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: But that's the gist of ot
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Is it competing against other groups?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: It*
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: No
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Hmmmm

12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Shamil Khan: How many escapes?
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: It can be just us
12/30/15, 11:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: And we have to beat the time technically
12/30/15, 11:56 PM - Hammad Mirza: <Media omitted>
12/30/15, 11:56 PM - Shamil Khan: It seems like it can be either really fun out really boring
12/30/15, 11:56 PM - Shamil Khan: It's hit or miss
12/30/15, 11:56 PM - Shamil Khan: You know?
12/30/15, 11:56 PM - Hammad Mirza: You didn't even know what it was lmaaoo

12/31/15, 5:55 PM - Belal Saleem: No one in the history of the game had his ball control, vision, and ability to create magical goals from absolutely nothing
12/31/15, 5:55 PM - Huzaifa: Copy paste off wiki?
12/31/15, 5:55 PM - Belal Saleem: No.2 has to be Pele for the amount of goals scored in his career as well as the fact that he has 3 world cups
12/31/15, 5:55 PM - Belal Saleem: That's unrepeatable in history
12/31/15, 5:56 PM - Qasim Malik: Damnnn Zidane really??? What the
12/31/15, 5:56 PM - Belal Saleem: Messi no 3. simply becuase of his stats and the fact that no one has won more in club football
12/31/15, 5:56 PM - Qasim Malik: So unexpected. I was happy to hear he is top 10 lmao
12/31/15, 5:56 PM - Belal Saleem: Qasim, peoplethag know football know how good zidane was
12/31/15, 5:56 PM - Belal Saleem: He wasn't a goal scorer

12/31/15, 5:57 PM - Belal Saleem: But only for those three years
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Belal Saleem: Before and after that he totally fell off
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Belal Saleem: Maradonna comes after messi imo
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Qasim Malik: True
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Qasim Malik: And Ronaldo?
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Qasim Malik: The new one
12/31/15, 5:58 PM - Belal Saleem: Cuz maradonna used a lot of steroids in his career and can't come close to messis stats
12/31/15, 5:59 PM - Qasim Malik: Who's the most shifty soccer player of all time?
12/31/15, 5:59 PM - Belal Saleem: Ronaldo would be like 5. After maradonna
12/31/15, 5:59 PM - Belal Saleem: Shifty?

12/31/15, 6:00 PM - Belal Saleem: He comes close
12/31/15, 6:01 PM - Belal Saleem: But zidane..... The epitome of grace and elegance on a football pitch

12/31/15, 6:02 PM - Belal Saleem: And he would put in a lot of work for his team defensively as well and one the best leaders and captain England ever had
12/31/15, 6:03 PM - Belal Saleem: Beckham speciality was scoring from fk's and not many I'm history can match him in that

1/3/16, 12:50 AM - Shamil Khan: I'd recommend against Java and C++ because you won't be building anything with them right away. It is just knowledge waiting to escape your brain.
1/3/16, 12:50 AM - Shamil Khan: Only learn java and c++ if you have a clear roadmap of where you want to use them.
1/3/16, 12:50 AM - Shamil Khan: Not to get an introduction to programming.
1/3/16, 12:50 AM - Shamil Khan: :)
1/3/16, 12:50 AM - Hammad Mirza: I disagree
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Shamil Khan: I'm getting the link.
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Mahmoud (NN): You two are gonna kill me
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Mahmoud (NN): What should I do
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Hammad Mirza: Lmaoo
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Shamil Khan: https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Hammad Mirza: I say start c++ just to get the fundamentals of programming since you haven't programmed yet
1/3/16, 12:51 AM - Hammad Mirza: But yeah shamils right by saying that you can't make anything with C++ and java
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: Hammad, I think Mahmoud needs instant gratification
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Hammad Mirza: Can't.make anything right away*
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Hammad Mirza: It will be just for knowledge
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Mahmoud (NN): No
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: It will get him in that zone.
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I am willing to go the long haul
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: And once he's in that zone, it is easier to commit.
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I need to be successful
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: And he can figure out what he likes and doesn't.
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: Mahmoud man. You're saying that now.
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: Remember the whole phone dilemma?
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Hammad Mirza: C++ is pretty easy and straight forward and he'll understand how programming actuslly works before trying to make something
1/3/16, 12:52 AM - Shamil Khan: It took you a year to decide. :(
1/3/16, 12:53 AM - Shamil Khan: Well you have both options Mahmoud buddy. Hammad also has a fair point.
1/3/16, 12:53 AM - Mahmoud (NN): :((((((
1/3/16, 12:53 AM - Hammad Mirza: I say if you want that instant gratification, do what shamils saying. If you wanna learn a bit more then do some c++ first
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Hammad Mirza: Because you can't make anything right away with C++ but you can with Shamils way
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: I would personally recommend you finish that course to get a feel for it. It'd an easier thing. You don't need any special IDEs, no compilers, no nothing. Someone is literally holding your hand guiding you. It will help you stick with it.
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: It's an easier appeal to human nature.
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: It's like going to go the gym.
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: You want to make your noob gains
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: See quick progress
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: Have something tangible in a week
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: Get more motivated
1/3/16, 12:54 AM - Shamil Khan: Build something else.
1/3/16, 12:55 AM - Shamil Khan: Finish the course and be knowledge hungry
1/3/16, 12:55 AM - Shamil Khan: I just think it's easier if you're really new.
1/3/16, 12:55 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Okay so what languages does it teach?
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Qasim Malik: To to Udemy
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Mahmoud (NN): ?
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Qasim Malik: Learn which ever language you want. They have a bunch of courses
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Qasim Malik: Read the descriptions
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Mahmoud (NN): This course that Shamil is talking about is from Udemy
1/3/16, 12:56 AM - Qasim Malik: Yeah
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Qasim Malik: Depending on the job you apply to, if required, it'll mention the programming laungage you should know
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: MAHMOUF
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: MAHMOUD
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: HOLY MAN
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: THE LINK TELLS H
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: U
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: WHAT IT TEACHES
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Shamil Khan: SHIT
1/3/16, 12:57 AM - Qasim Malik: Unless you're going into a developer role, you're not gonna need to know programming at a low level
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: Mahmoud mannnnn :(
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Qasim Malik: If you watch basic programming knowledge, listen to Shamil
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: You disappoint me.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: Once you do that course, you'll be power hungry Mahmoud.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: That is when you delve deeper into object oriented programming.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: Design patterns.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: Industry standards.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: It's all a learning curve.
1/3/16, 12:58 AM - Shamil Khan: You always keep learning.
1/3/16, 12:59 AM - Qasim Malik: Just get introduced to any programming language. The logic is often very similar, all you have to do is pick up the syntax. Learning a programming language gets easier once you know one or two
1/3/16, 12:59 AM - Shamil Khan: But Mahmoud bro, you'll never learn if you keep talking about it
1/3/16, 12:59 AM - Shamil Khan: You have to do it.
1/3/16, 12:59 AM - Shamil Khan: Something is better than nothing.
1/3/16, 12:59 AM - Qasim Malik: After you've learned one, its easy to learn another one*
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: Just pace yourself and you should be fine.
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: And if you're going to be in Mississauga, get that gym membership.
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: I'll go with you and give you a basic program to start training.
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: :)
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: :))))
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shaham: I'm with Shamil, do the course. Ull get a bit of a feel for programming and instant gratification.
1/3/16, 1:00 AM - Shamil Khan: +1 Shaham
1/3/16, 1:01 AM - Qasim Malik: I say learn the web development ones first. I think they are the most practical to know imo
1/3/16, 1:01 AM - Shamil Khan: Yep
1/3/16, 1:01 AM - Shamil Khan: Agreed.
1/3/16, 1:02 AM - Shamil Khan: <Media omitted>
1/3/16, 1:02 AM - Qasim Malik: Unless you plan on becoming a developer, I don't think you need to know all those languages you mentioned. Know what each is used for, for sure, but you don't necessarily have to learn it.
1/3/16, 1:03 AM - Shamil Khan: Tbh once you get a feel for it, you'll just learn on your job. Qasim is right. If you're gonna go in project management, you don't need to know all of them.
1/3/16, 1:03 AM - Mahmoud (NN): <Media omitted>
1/3/16, 1:03 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Done
1/3/16, 1:03 AM - Qasim Malik: Just get a feel for programming first. Take the course.
1/3/16, 1:04 AM - Qasim Malik: Good. Put yourself on deadlines, hold yourself to account.
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: +1
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: Mahmoud bro, feel free to message me if you have any questions.
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: Or Shaham
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: He's done most of the course I think
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: But you gotta push yourself
1/3/16, 1:05 AM - Shamil Khan: Don't do too much in a day
1/3/16, 1:06 AM - Shamil Khan: Qasim did u finish the course too?
1/3/16, 1:06 AM - Qasim Malik: Once you do this course, it'll become easier to pick up the other programming languages you mentioned. For sure.
1/3/16, 1:06 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I know that I have to pace myself otherwise it'll be a waste
1/3/16, 1:06 AM - Qasim Malik: Not finished. I fell off. But I intend on doing it all over again
1/3/16, 1:06 AM - Shamil Khan: Mahmoud, the application building really helps you stay on track.
1/3/16, 1:07 AM - Shamil Khan: Let me know once you're done. I'll hook you up with some books.
1/3/16, 1:07 AM - Shamil Khan: ;)
1/3/16, 1:08 AM - Huzaifa: 😉
1/3/16, 1:09 AM - Shamil Khan: Huzaifa ruined our happy moment.
1/3/16, 1:09 AM - Shamil Khan: Leave, man.
1/3/16, 1:09 AM - Shamil Khan: Just leave.
1/3/16, 1:10 AM - Belal Saleem: Mahmoud, I'm glad you taking this initiative
1/3/16, 1:10 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Thanks bro
1/3/16, 1:10 AM - Mahmoud (NN): to be honest Im a little intimidated
1/3/16, 1:10 AM - Shamil Khan: Belal, you should take it too if you're interested
1/3/16, 1:10 AM - Shamil Khan: Mahmoud bro, I totally feel you on that intimidation.
1/3/16, 1:11 AM - Shamil Khan: I swear to God every new thing intimidates me
1/3/16, 1:11 AM - Belal Saleem: I've never had an interest in coding but it's always good example and horizons
1/3/16, 1:11 AM - Belal Saleem: To expand *
1/3/16, 1:12 AM - Belal Saleem: And yo, for some reason, my left ankle really hurts
1/3/16, 1:12 AM - Belal Saleem: Like what the hell man

1/3/16, 1:12 AM - Shamil Khan: Ice it.
1/3/16, 1:12 AM - Shamil Khan: Hopefully it isn't sprained.
1/3/16, 1:13 AM - Shamil Khan: Ice will settle the inflammation.
1/3/16, 1:13 AM - Belal Saleem: Yeah, soccer and basketball
1/3/16, 1:13 AM - Shamil Khan: SOCCER?
1/3/16, 1:13 AM - Shamil Khan: WHO DIDN'T INVITE ME

1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Belal Saleem: But I didn't injur It while playing or anything
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Qasim Malik: Bro you would've fainted after game 1 anyway
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Shamil Khan: Wow.
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Belal Saleem: It just started after I came home
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Shamil Khan: But that one game though
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Shamil Khan: ;)
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Shamil Khan: Yeah I'm gonna start running again insha Allah. My stamina is lacking.
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Belal Saleem: And shamil you had to be somewhere you couldn't have made it anyway
1/3/16, 1:14 AM - Shamil Khan: Belal, it could just be that you used it after a little while.
1/3/16, 1:15 AM - Shamil Khan: Insha Allah it should feel better in a few days.
1/3/16, 1:15 AM - Shamil Khan: May Allah give you shifa

1/4/16, 1:47 AM - Shamil Khan: It's all relative bro
1/4/16, 1:47 AM - Shamil Khan: We will show him
1/4/16, 1:47 AM - Shamil Khan: Once our startup is successful
1/4/16, 1:47 AM - Shaham: W.e. let's stop talking about all of it
1/4/16, 1:47 AM - Shamil Khan: He will come to us

1/4/16, 1:51 AM - Qasim Malik: 😂
1/4/16, 1:51 AM - Shaham: It's like some extra supplement stuff thats like...semi-drugish and medically dangerous
1/4/16, 1:51 AM - Belal Saleem: Lool
1/4/16, 1:52 AM - Belal Saleem: Sucks for you guys, my school starts on the 11th
1/4/16, 1:52 AM - Qasim Malik: Loool they won't stress once they see your gains
1/4/16, 1:52 AM - Shaham: And the way they talk about it, it reminds me of the research I did before that led me away from it...
1/4/16, 1:52 AM - Qasim Malik: Mine on the 18th.. Be careful who you speak to
1/4/16, 1:52 AM - Shaham: And dude they don't like gains

1/7/16, 4:04 AM - Shamil Khan: Very interesting post by Abu Esa.
1/7/16, 4:04 AM - Shamil Khan: The number of Muslims who don't stay in their lane, speaking about things they are not qualified on, or ready for, is growing fast; it's like a viral breakout, a disease which has become endemic amongst us.

Social media really has become a fitnah for them. It gave a platform to those who should not be on it.

Perhaps they were saved from clubbing or dating or doing drugs etc, and instead started "practising" only to become addicted to another drug which is even worse: speaking without knowledge, "educating" without being educated, "warning" when ignorant, typing because they simply can, and so on.

Once one is bitten by the bug of fame and attention, it is near impossible to go back. You think you can start talking about usul because of a few classes you take, and you think you can talk about bid'ah because you can pronounce the letter 'ayn - in fact, they always seem to have a great letter 'ayn, right? - and you think you can teach when you are wholly ignorant of the Shari'ah, and you think you can try and explain matters when you don't even know the Arabic language, let alone all the sciences that follow.

Is this status about YOU? Yes it is. I don't need to mention one name as a flag-bearer of this disease when I aiming this at 50 of you who try and do the same but at varying levels of success. If you're thinking "it's me he's talking about", then you'd be right. If you're feeling paranoid right now, you should be. Because I *am* talking about you. Yes I've read your statements. Yes I also have a personal account on social media too and see and read what everyone else is talking about on my friends and liked lists. You shouldn't have gone there in the first place. This is what happens. If you rise like a balloon, full of gas, then expect someone to pop you when you talk nonsense or try to come across as someone you're not and mislead people. Is that me judging you? Sure thing. Hatin' on you? Absolutely. Forcing you to only stick to what you're good at. Correct.

You wanted to give da'wah? Your keeping silent for a good few years will be the best da'wah you will ever give. You want to be an activist? Get off FB and actually get active and help someone. We don't need any more heroes online. The world doesn't need you. Believe me, it doesn't. Your style isn't so new, and your approach isn't so unique so as to justify the masses being exposed to an ignoramus. There is a huge difference between sharing content from qualified people and reminding folks that way - a great and encouraged thing - and you trying to do reminding from your own pocket and not knowing what you're talking about.

And sometimes, you *will* know what you're talking about, but you should remain silent. Just to learn the system. Just to learn the skill of patience and humility. It will serve you well later when it is time for you to lead.

I studied for nearly seven years - that's full time, not part time classes, and that's proper studying, not "practising" and living as a Muslim - before my teacher told me to go public with da'wah. My mouth and my fingers were quiet during that time. I studied for another seven before I had the belief and support from my teachers that I should have an opinion that is worth listening to. It's taken me another five years to realise that opinion isn't worth much at all, wa Allahu'l-Musta'an.

Son, just stay in your lane. Please. For your own sake.
1/7/16, 6:54 AM - Hammad Mirza: Woah, he went offff
1/7/16, 8:32 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I completely agree with him. Not because I have felt that this group needs to be addressed. But because if he had "gone easy" he would have risked describing a much broader group.
1/7/16, 8:32 AM - Mahmoud (NN): He is very specific in terms of who he is addressing
1/7/16, 8:45 AM - Shaham: Wow Shamil.posted an opinion

1/10/16, 11:42 AM - Shamil Khan: So you'll pay that for the first month
1/10/16, 11:42 AM - Shamil Khan: Then it is 10 bucks a month

1/10/16, 11:43 AM - Shamil Khan: http://worldgymmississauga.thememberspot.com/SignUp

1/10/16, 11:43 AM - Shamil Khan: HOLY SHIT
1/10/16, 11:43 AM - Shamil Khan: 29 + 9(10) + 2(20)
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Shamil Khan: That's your first year, plus applicable taxes.
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Shamil Khan: Or is the charge additional?
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Shamil Khan: Nvm it is 20 bucks on top of your 10
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Shamil Khan: For those two months.
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Why is there an additional 40
1/10/16, 11:44 AM - Shamil Khan: So 29 + 11(10) + 40
1/10/16, 11:45 AM - Shamil Khan: To keep the cost competitive.
1/10/16, 11:45 AM - Shamil Khan: Or some crap
1/10/16, 11:45 AM - Shamil Khan: And minimum sign up is 1 year.

1/10/16, 11:46 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I won't have to pay in Waterloo
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: Yeah, but still
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: You come home.
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: U need it bro
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: I go to Waterloo too. Yet I still need this membership
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: It's an added convenience and forces you to go.
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: Only way you can convince yourself to go is if you are motivated
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: I can't motivate you
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: No one else can
1/10/16, 11:47 AM - Shamil Khan: Only YOU can
1/10/16, 11:49 AM - Mahmoud (NN): But I'll probably just use lighter weights
1/10/16, 11:50 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Not as cute as you just yet
1/10/16, 11:55 AM - Shamil Khan: Bro, the most common mistake is ego lifting. People thinking they need to lift higher weights.
1/10/16, 11:56 AM - Shamil Khan: You build muscle by breaking down muscle tissue. Lower weights and higher reps train your muscular system.
1/10/16, 11:56 AM - Shamil Khan: Higher weights and lower reps train your nervous system and allow you to basically make your muscles denser.
1/10/16, 11:57 AM - Shamil Khan: Those bodybuilders and people that just look good aesthetically, train with lower weights. :)
1/10/16, 11:57 AM - Shamil Khan: That being said, you will increase your weights regardless in the first few months. It will feel amazing buddy.
1/10/16, 11:58 AM - Shamil Khan: Just say bismillah and get started. Human beings get nothing more than what they strive for.
1/10/16, 11:58 AM - Shamil Khan: :)))))))))))))))

1/14/16, 3:48 PM - Shamil Khan: and so is mech
1/14/16, 3:48 PM - Abdullah Ansari: He's fine with that, he prefers mech, its just that his fam is pushing him for chemical so
1/14/16, 3:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: Lots of mech jobs

1/14/16, 4:40 PM - Shaham: If I told you philosophically 'be like water' what would you take that to mean?
1/14/16, 4:44 PM - Shaham: Nothing?
1/14/16, 4:44 PM - Shaham: Qasim I thought you were about to say something !
1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Qasim Malik: Hmm
1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Qasim Malik: Someone who's presence people thirst for, as though they need him/her
1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Qasim Malik: Iunno
1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Shaham: Okay cool
1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Qasim Malik: Smooth to touch? Lmao

1/14/16, 4:45 PM - Qasim Malik: What was yours?
1/14/16, 4:46 PM - Shaham: I want others to say too
1/14/16, 4:46 PM - Shaham: And then I have a follow up
1/14/16, 4:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: I thought it meant you should easily adjust to the environment around you
1/14/16, 4:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: Water takes the shape of its container = we easily adjust to surroundings
1/14/16, 4:48 PM - Shaham: Okay sweet
1/14/16, 4:49 PM - Mahmoud (NN): That's what I was thinking Hammad
1/14/16, 4:52 PM - Shaham: What does adjustment mean to you? Would you say its assimilating or accommodating? The different being assimilate mean u change urself to match surrounding (ex.start becoming very math in engineering), accommodating meaning don't change urself but try and fit the environment with relation to you already are (focus on the what ur good at in engineering and just do the minimal math)?
1/14/16, 4:52 PM - Shaham: Very good in math*
1/14/16, 4:57 PM - Shamil Khan: water = pure
1/14/16, 4:57 PM - Shamil Khan: transparent
1/14/16, 4:57 PM - Shamil Khan: no need to hide things

1/14/16, 4:59 PM - Shamil Khan: we gotta teach Abdullah
1/14/16, 4:59 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Adapt to whatever situation you're in
1/14/16, 4:59 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Be adhesive ;)
1/14/16, 5:00 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Be easy on people, flow smoothly
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: Agree with shamil
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: And shaham made a good distinction between assimilating and accommodation
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: The saying be like water's traditional meaning is be adaptable (simplifying here) however, thats not the only lesson you can take from it
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: There is always more then one lesson in something
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: Better to accommodate, you should never give up something in your nature to fit in better with the surroundings, it's a fine line and easily to overstep it but I feel it's really important
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: Mainly though, anything that comes to you is only what you take from it, which I'm pretty sure we all know, but it means that people also attach different meanings to stuff unless they decide to run with the status quo
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: People always attach definite meanings to things whereas I think things are rarely definite in this world
1/14/16, 5:08 PM - Belal Saleem: Its all perception and perspective, but the main thing is you should always take away something positive from every experience
1/14/16, 5:20 PM - Qasim Malik: We are a product of what we surround ourselves with. We shape into whichever shape the container is.
1/14/16, 5:21 PM - Qasim Malik: Like a sponge, we absorb and we become
1/14/16, 5:21 PM - Qasim Malik: <Media omitted>
1/14/16, 5:23 PM - Belal Saleem: You look sleazy in that pic no lie

1/17/16, 6:02 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Man consists of the mind of  an angel, the lust of an animal, and the fancy of Satan. One of them will prevail. If you could overcome your fancy and lust, you will be in a rank that is higher than an angel. And if your fancy and lust beat you, you will be in a rank that is less than a dog.

1/17/16, 10:52 PM - Shaham: I will man. But try not to isolate yourself too much
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: Sounds cool
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Mahmoud (NN): What?
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shaham: Hammad, we have to train an emotional recognition model that you feed tweets into and it tells if they are happy, neutral, or sad
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: Bro remember all that calling ive been having

1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: I need that isolation to get my brain in order.
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: I need a break, lol
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shaham: I think it's an escape, not a calling.
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Mahmoud (NN): Become a hermit
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: And I gotta road trip it across Canada.
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shaham: Break is fine
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: But I need that escape
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: Not permanent
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Mahmoud (NN): Hermittt
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Shamil Khan: But for some time.
1/17/16, 10:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: And nature calms you down
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shamil Khan: I know
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Something about a glowing river
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Nature is beautiful
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Or waves on a shore
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: 👌🏽
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Mahmoud (NN): I bend water
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Flowing river*

1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Mahmoud (NN): I can't :/
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shaham: The thing is though depression can encourage isolation desires within you that will only make it worse
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shamil Khan: I've lost interest in work
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shaham: You have to watch out for that
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shamil Khan: In projects
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Shamil Khan: Yeah, true.
1/17/16, 10:54 PM - Hammad Mirza: Chill with your family

1/18/16, 12:25 AM - Shaham: <Media omitted>
1/18/16, 12:40 AM - Qasim Malik: My bro✊🏽
1/18/16, 12:41 AM - Mahmoud (NN): Power is coursing through my veins
1/18/16, 12:41 AM - Mahmoud (NN): I am HE MAN
1/18/16, 1:00 AM - Shaham: Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?? Say yes say yes, cauz I need to know. You say ill never get your blessing till the day I die, tough luck my friend but the answer is still no 🎶🎶
1/18/16, 6:12 AM - Hammad Mirza: Is that rumi
1/18/16, 10:05 AM - Shaham: 😄
1/18/16, 12:31 PM - Shamil Khan: http://www.speed-light.info/miracles_of_quran/age_of_universe.htm
1/18/16, 12:31 PM - Shamil Khan: very interesting read
1/18/16, 12:36 PM - Belal Saleem: Why does the author keep saying "moslems"
1/18/16, 12:37 PM - Belal Saleem: Apart from that, like you said, very interesting read
1/18/16, 12:43 PM - Shamil Khan: Yeah no idea why lol
1/18/16, 12:43 PM - Shamil Khan: Maybe it's targeted towards a certain audience
1/18/16, 12:43 PM - Belal Saleem: 'Muricans
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: Wow I've never thought of this stuff on terms of relativity
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Shamil Khan: It's very cool
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Belal Saleem: I know right
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: I just assumed the 1 day in hereafter = however many days on earth as something that can be passed off as something we have no knowledge of
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Hammad Mirza: Pretty cool
1/18/16, 12:48 PM - Belal Saleem: People usually think that science and Islam can't be correlated but it can
1/18/16, 12:49 PM - Belal Saleem: But what do us moslems know
1/18/16, 1:10 PM - Qasim Malik: SubhanAllah
1/18/16, 1:10 PM - Qasim Malik: But yo, I didn't know wormholes actually exist lol
1/18/16, 1:10 PM - Qasim Malik: Thought they were fictional
1/18/16, 1:10 PM - Belal Saleem: Its a theory
1/18/16, 1:11 PM - Belal Saleem: They may not
1/18/16, 1:11 PM - Belal Saleem: But there is sufficient scientific fact to suggest it's possible
1/18/16, 1:11 PM - Qasim Malik: I see
1/18/16, 1:49 PM - Shaham: Interesting read but I'm pretty against discussions like this
1/18/16, 1:49 PM - Shaham: This makes a huge assumption that rules of the universe will be continued
1/18/16, 1:50 PM - Shaham: Eternal places theologically are above the universe. The entire universe is a single sky
1/18/16, 1:50 PM - Shaham: And when God says he will roll up everything until only He is left and then recreate, some interpret that as a new construction of physics (as we know it)
1/18/16, 1:51 PM - Shaham: Science and Islam can of course be correlated but things like this are artificial pushing trying to make it make sense.
1/18/16, 1:51 PM - Qasim Malik: Good point
1/18/16, 1:55 PM - Hammad Mirza: Yeah, in the end, Allah hu alam
1/18/16, 1:55 PM - Hammad Mirza: Still a pretty cool observation
1/18/16, 1:55 PM - Hammad Mirza: No way we can know if earth's laws extend to the heavens
1/18/16, 1:58 PM - Shamil Khan: I agree with Shaham exactly. We shouldn't try and make Islam conform to science, but we should also keep our minds open to marvel at the creations of Allah. Science isn't constant. Islam is!
1/18/16, 2:00 PM - Abdullah Ansari: Ye its still is just a matter of perspective and interpretation, trying to fit the pieces together
1/18/16, 8:20 PM - Mahmoud (NN): Guys how do you download audio on to nexus from YouTube

1/22/16, 3:38 PM - Shaham: Qasim take a step back. Realize a woman won't fill the void in you no matter how much you want it. Then, do your reading and reflection and then we can talk about your irrational statements
1/22/16, 3:39 PM - Belal Saleem: Lol
1/22/16, 3:39 PM - Belal Saleem: "do the reading and reflection"
1/22/16, 3:39 PM - Qasim Malik: Maybe they won't, but it feels good thinking they might
1/22/16, 3:39 PM - Belal Saleem: You don't play around eh

1/22/16, 3:40 PM - Qasim Malik: I'd love a companion from the opposite gender to share my empty hearted struggles with

1/22/16, 3:41 PM - Qasim Malik: I know I know
1/22/16, 3:41 PM - Qasim Malik: I'm just a bit moist from that dream that's all
1/22/16, 3:41 PM - Belal Saleem: Obviously we all want that bro but sometimes, just sometimes, it's better not to know where Allah is taking us and enjoy the journey and not worry about the destination so much
1/22/16, 3:41 PM - Belal Saleem: 😀
1/22/16, 3:41 PM - Qasim Malik: Wish I knew who the girl was. Swear I'd hit her up, so maybe its good I don't know who she is lmao

1/22/16, 3:42 PM - Belal Saleem: Or should be to some degree
1/22/16, 3:42 PM - Belal Saleem: Its good to feel emotion bro how else are you alive
1/22/16, 3:43 PM - Qasim Malik: An impulse buyer too. Usually when I wait a while and think rationally, I no longer want the thing I wanted so bad during that moment
1/22/16, 3:43 PM - Shaham: Every human is emotionally driven, chill

1/31/16, 10:18 PM - Hammad Mirza: Huziafa was the first verse you tried

1/31/16, 10:22 PM - Shamil Khan: No I told him to do a surah

1/31/16, 10:24 PM - Qasim Malik: Pretty cool. Thought of this before
1/31/16, 10:24 PM - Qasim Malik: But doest it recognize voices from a computer?
1/31/16, 10:25 PM - Qasim Malik: Or just if you recite in front of it?
1/31/16, 10:25 PM - Hammad Mirza: Didn't try a comp
1/31/16, 10:25 PM - Hammad Mirza: But I don't see why it wouldn't
1/31/16, 10:25 PM - Hammad Mirza: If the volume is pretty loud it should work
1/31/16, 10:26 PM - Qasim Malik: Nah, cause Google voice input doesn't take sounds from a computer or speaker.
1/31/16, 10:26 PM - Qasim Malik: So if they used googles apk, then it wont take sounds from a computer
1/31/16, 10:27 PM - Shamil Khan: Qasim, it could take input from computer too
1/31/16, 10:27 PM - Shamil Khan: Hammad, remember when we used Google on the computer?

1/31/16, 10:28 PM - Hammad Mirza: It's tough to get it to work
1/31/16, 10:29 PM - Hammad Mirza: I think the problem is.how.clear the audio is from the comp
1/31/16, 10:29 PM - Hammad Mirza: It's usually not high def audio if you're playing from YouTube so itll have trouble.picking it up

2/4/16, 3:05 PM - Qasim Malik: Honestly, I'm gonna go ahead and say Curry is top 5 all time.
2/4/16, 3:06 PM - Qasim Malik: I've never ever ever in my entire past, at any level of basketball, dominate like Curry did last night. Lebron, Kobe, nobody did it like Curry last night.
2/4/16, 3:06 PM - Qasim Malik: Shaham, that's a must watch.
2/4/16, 3:06 PM - Qasim Malik: 11/16 three's, 19/28 from the field.
2/4/16, 3:07 PM - Belal Saleem: You make me laugh
2/4/16, 3:07 PM - Qasim Malik: Curry is top 10 threes made in a single season EVER and we haven't even hit the all star break 😂😂😭😭😭
2/4/16, 3:08 PM - Qasim Malik: Belal, at this point your opinion means nothing. Curry is having the best season of all time. Funny thing is, he's the reigning MVP and he deserves most improved player.
2/4/16, 3:08 PM - Qasim Malik: Not much else to say
2/4/16, 3:08 PM - Qasim Malik: Belal, don't say anything. Watch the highlights
2/4/16, 3:08 PM - Belal Saleem: Best season of all time.... This is why millennial are made fun of
2/4/16, 3:08 PM - Qasim Malik: He's doing this night in/night out
2/4/16, 3:09 PM - Qasim Malik: You're a millennial. Please bro, stop embarrassing yourself just to have an opinion.
2/4/16, 3:09 PM - Qasim Malik: Watch^^^^^
2/4/16, 3:09 PM - Belal Saleem: Let's wait till the playoffs
2/4/16, 3:09 PM - Belal Saleem: And then judge him
2/4/16, 3:09 PM - Qasim Malik: Cool
2/4/16, 3:10 PM - Belal Saleem: If you were so confident Curry was this good you wouldn't feel the need to prove it this often
2/4/16, 3:10 PM - Belal Saleem: Lebron is still a more complete player then Curry, the game is more the just 3pt shooting
2/4/16, 3:11 PM - Qasim Malik: <Media omitted>
2/4/16, 3:11 PM - Qasim Malik: Lmaooooooo
2/4/16, 3:11 PM - Belal Saleem: Only one laughing is you
2/4/16, 3:11 PM - Qasim Malik: Swear you don't know basketball. Curry's game isn't just a 3 ball.
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Qasim Malik: You haven't even watched the video. That's arrogant.
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Belal Saleem: Could Curry lead a team of nobodies to the finals like lebron did in 07
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Qasim Malik: Curry's a champion
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Belal Saleem: Highlights and regular season don't mean that much, how about lebrons 61 points
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Qasim Malik: Lmao bro, your arguments suck. Sorry man.
2/4/16, 3:12 PM - Belal Saleem: Lebron is a two time champion with two finals MVPs and 4 regular season MVPs
2/4/16, 3:13 PM - Belal Saleem: Your only argument is "llmmaaoooo"
2/4/16, 3:13 PM - Belal Saleem: Lebron, on a championship winning team, led the team in points assist, blocks, fg% usage rage, steals and blocks
2/4/16, 3:13 PM - Belal Saleem: Curry can't do that
2/4/16, 3:14 PM - Qasim Malik: First off, I never said Lebron wasn't great lol, second, Lebron hasn't had a season like Curry's. Ever.
2/4/16, 3:14 PM - Shaham: I will watch it iA. Watchinf curry is inspiring man and it'd artistic.
2/4/16, 3:14 PM - Qasim Malik: Please someone watch that video!!
2/4/16, 3:14 PM - Shaham: I feel like I'm reading an intense book
2/4/16, 3:15 PM - Belal Saleem: Curry can shoot way better then lebron and his handles are better, but lebron is a betterpasser, rebounder, defender,and can strap a team on his back
2/4/16, 3:15 PM - Qasim Malik: Ahhh. We don't watch just to know, we watch to feel.
2/4/16, 3:15 PM - Qasim Malik: Ehh?
2/4/16, 3:16 PM - Shaham: Experience art > knowing
2/4/16, 3:16 PM - Qasim Malik: Shaham, I took that from your writing ^^^

2/4/16, 10:42 PM - Belal Saleem: Tug tbh
2/4/16, 10:44 PM - Qasim Malik: I'm expecting Shaham to be able to solve it!
2/4/16, 10:44 PM - Usamah Wadud: Daniel did it!
2/4/16, 10:45 PM - Qasim Malik: State your reasoning.
2/4/16, 10:45 PM - Qasim Malik: Once you know, you'll know.
2/4/16, 10:45 PM - Qasim Malik: If you're unsure, you're probably wrong
2/4/16, 10:45 PM - Usamah Wadud: Oh wait
2/4/16, 10:45 PM - Usamah Wadud: Its tug
2/4/16, 10:46 PM - Usamah Wadud: Cause daniel said tug, but tug said daniel lied, which means tug did it or he knows who did it
2/4/16, 10:48 PM - Qasim Malik: Nope, sorry
2/4/16, 10:49 PM - Huzaifa: Garth cuz everyone lied
2/4/16, 10:50 PM - Qasim Malik: It says one person told the truth

2/14/16, 6:29 PM - Shaham: Shamil my dad actually wants to talk with u about icnas systems
2/14/16, 6:29 PM - Shaham: He's getting involved with that to take away some of the burden all of ICNA had placed on you 😂😂
2/14/16, 6:34 PM - Shamil Khan: Shaham bro
2/14/16, 6:34 PM - Shamil Khan: I'm a ghost

2/14/16, 6:35 PM - Shamil Khan: I had this whole plan for automation that I have never been able to complete due to school
2/14/16, 6:36 PM - Shamil Khan: So if that gets implemented, or if there is a better way to implement it... Some people's jobs in ICNA will be at risk.
2/14/16, 6:36 PM - Shamil Khan: Because there is such a huge reliance on manual stuff. ;(
2/14/16, 6:36 PM - Shamil Khan: Let's figure out a time to meet your dad
2/14/16, 6:36 PM - Shamil Khan: ;)

2/14/16, 8:49 PM - Shamil Khan: It looks like you'd shank someone if they looked at you wrong
2/14/16, 8:49 PM - Shaham: This is my freedom
2/14/16, 8:49 PM - Shamil Khan: ;)
2/14/16, 8:49 PM - Hammad Mirza: Lmaaooo shaham

2/14/16, 8:50 PM - Hammad Mirza: Ball is lyfe
2/14/16, 8:50 PM - Shaham: I don't mind basketball btw, its not like that, its just these hype games
2/14/16, 8:51 PM - Hammad Mirza: Yeah that's understandable

2/14/16, 8:52 PM - Shaham: Then
2/14/16, 8:52 PM - Shaham: I swear to God , I decided internally that I would come back and find more committed people to chill with but then I went to umrah and decided to still hang with u cause of Islam
2/14/16, 8:53 PM - Hammad Mirza: LOOOL damn you snapped
2/14/16, 8:53 PM - Shaham: Akxidnsixjdnsnd

2/14/16, 8:56 PM - Shaham: I would never
2/14/16, 8:56 PM - Shaham: Ditch in a situation like that
2/14/16, 8:56 PM - Hammad Mirza: Loool I know I'm jk
2/14/16, 8:56 PM - Shaham: Unless Tariq Ramadan was visiting my house
2/14/16, 8:57 PM - Shaham: Literally to see me one on one
2/14/16, 8:57 PM - Shaham: Then, I'd consider it
2/14/16, 8:57 PM - Shaham: If it was shia Labeouf, I'd cancel on him.
2/14/16, 8:58 PM - Hammad Mirza: I had been waiting for raptors being in the playoffs for 6 years at the time so obv I was gonna be hyped

2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shaham: Yeah I'm on twitter. Trust me, I know hype.
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Belal Saleem: I would've ditched the game for you shaham
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Belal Saleem: Just sayin
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shaham: My problem.is what that hype leads to
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shaham: Belal ❤
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Hammad Mirza: No you see the hype, but you don't feel the hype for those things. People get hyped about some things which I don't understand
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Hammad Mirza: Belal we didn't ditch him. He came to qasims house and me Qasim and him watched the game together
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shaham: This isn't about whether ppl get hyped or not..
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shamil Khan: LOL
2/14/16, 8:59 PM - Shamil Khan: HAMMAD DITCHED U?
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: Hammad wth
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shamil Khan: TO WATCH THE GAME?
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: I can't believe ur gonna go there
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shamil Khan: WOWOWOWOWOWOWO HAMMAD
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shamil Khan: Hammad is a snake tbh
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: I was miserable every minute
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: In that house
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shamil Khan: Let's excommunicate him
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Hammad Mirza: We were sitting in qasims living room
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: And I'm sure y'all knew it
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Belal Saleem: Lol Hammad trying to clear his name with me
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: I was dying to get out
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Belal Saleem: Don't even
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Shaham: And don't try to weasal out, I likes ur sorry not sorry response better
2/14/16, 9:00 PM - Hammad Mirza: Yeah that's fair but trying to justify how that hype is wrong isn't right
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: Than this pathetic buffoonery
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Hammad Mirza: Just saying I didn't "ditch"
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Hammad Mirza: Whatever you want that word to mean
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: I never said hype is wrong. I said the priorities
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: Bro...
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: It's ditch in every sense of the word except for the action of ditching
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: Because u made it so bad
2/14/16, 9:01 PM - Shaham: That I had to leave
2/14/16, 9:02 PM - Shaham: Technically  ditching myself
2/14/16, 9:07 PM - Hammad Mirza: Goes both ways. Should understand me and Qasim were gonna watch that game no matter what, whether you believe in hype or not and what comes with hype. But yeah useless conversation. Idk why you're bringing it up 2 years later
2/14/16, 9:07 PM - Huzaifa: Settle down now boys, I'm sure we can handle this like adults
2/14/16, 9:07 PM - Hammad Mirza: Brb gonna watch this game and be hyped
2/14/16, 9:08 PM - Shamil Khan: Hammad is pissed
2/14/16, 9:08 PM - Shamil Khan: Oh snappppppp
2/14/16, 9:09 PM - Shaham: <Media omitted>
2/14/16, 9:09 PM - Shaham: Whoa wait y is Hammad pissed
2/14/16, 9:09 PM - Shaham: This was a casual reminder of his unfaithfulness..
2/14/16, 9:09 PM - Shaham: Whats the big deal
2/14/16, 9:19 PM - Hammad Mirza: Because you think its absurd that someone could be hyped about something you don't understand the hype for
2/14/16, 9:20 PM - Shaham: Yooo man I have no problem with hype!!!/
2/14/16, 9:20 PM - Hammad Mirza: Sure
2/14/16, 9:20 PM - Shaham: Im simply saying I didn't appreciate prioritizing hype over me
2/14/16, 9:20 PM - Shaham: I think that's something that's reasonable for me to say
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: Even if u don't agree. Which like I said I know u won't understand it and I won't ever understand ur side
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Hammad Mirza: I think you're exaggerating like crazy. Games are 2.5 hrs long
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: And yes yes hype with all the 'I've been waiting '
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: Bro I was down until late night
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Hammad Mirza: See, that sarcastic tone
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: And I was trying all day
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: From.afternoon
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Hammad Mirza: Makes it hard to believe you understand he other perspective
2/14/16, 9:21 PM - Shaham: U guys got time at night
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: And then u chose the game
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Hammad Mirza: Game was from like 7-9:30 or something
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shamil Khan: Hammad man
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: U were busy all day! Don't u remember
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Hammad Mirza: Shamil stop
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shamil Khan: Snake
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: And Hammad I told u I DONT understand ur perspective
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: Cause I wouldn't have done that
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: That's my whole beef
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shaham: If I understood it why would I be cheesed
2/14/16, 9:22 PM - Shamil Khan: Guys lets bury the hatchet.
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: For some things you have to say "I don't understand but imma let it go because I understand it means something to them. Idk what it means but it means something so ima let it go and let it be"
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: You're like, victimizing me qasim
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Shaham: And I disagree that basketball games are something I can feel that towards
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: Making it look like we're horrible people
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Shaham: That's not called victimizing
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: For watching an important game vs chilling with you
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Shaham: I'm definitely not making u victims
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: Sorry not victimizing
2/14/16, 9:24 PM - Hammad Mirza: Antagonists*
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: 👍🏼
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Hammad Mirza: Chill, I don't read books
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: And yeah I sort of am.
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: That's the whole beef.
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Hammad Mirza: Which I don't think is cool
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: Not saying ur horrible people
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: I'm saying I think that's as a mean thing to do
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: Absolutely... I mean why else would I be cheesed
2/14/16, 9:25 PM - Shaham: Was a mean*
2/14/16, 9:26 PM - Shaham: U want me to be mad about all of it but still think you guys did the best thing?
2/14/16, 9:27 PM - Shaham: And also its not just 'chillong' with me
2/14/16, 9:27 PM - Shaham: U say I don't understand hype
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Shaham: But u don't seem to be understanding I was leaving for a year so yeah I was kinda feeling more than just 'wanting to chill'
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Hammad Mirza: Was this the day before you left?
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Shaham: Literally
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Shaham: The day.
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Shaham: Before.
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Shaham: I left.
2/14/16, 9:28 PM - Hammad Mirza: But that was to pak
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Hammad Mirza: The game was in April
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Shaham: For 3 months and then from there
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Shaham: To Cali
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Shaham: I reached back for 2 days
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Shaham: But that's besides the point
2/14/16, 9:29 PM - Shaham: Cause like I said, to me, I was leaving.
2/14/16, 9:30 PM - Hammad Mirza: I don't remember what happened that day but not sure why we didn't chill before the game. That would've made sense to do
2/14/16, 9:31 PM - Shaham: Yeah it would have
2/14/16, 9:31 PM - Hammad Mirza: I remember, to me I knew you didn't like ball but thought it was fine that we were just at qasims house chilling while watching the game
2/14/16, 9:32 PM - Hammad Mirza: Seemed like a decent compromise
2/14/16, 9:32 PM - Hammad Mirza: My bad for not seeing 2 years into the future and knowing you were pissed off the entire time
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: Dude I'm not pissed now
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: I was pissed then
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: It doesn't matter..-.-
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Hammad Mirza: Pissed off the entire time at that time*
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: Well like I said
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: Umrah
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: I got rid of it
2/14/16, 9:33 PM - Shaham: I just brought it up cause the big bball game reminded me
2/14/16, 9:34 PM - Belal Saleem: I'm not talking sides
2/14/16, 9:34 PM - Shaham: All that led to was me developing a deep hatred for big bball games is all I was saying before you started arguing
2/14/16, 9:35 PM - Belal Saleem: But to me, human interaction and involvement ie chilling with Ur guys wins over watching a sporting event
2/14/16, 9:35 PM - Belal Saleem: And ima huge soccer basketball fan
2/14/16, 9:36 PM - Hammad Mirza: That's fully taking sides lmaoo
2/14/16, 9:36 PM - Belal Saleem: Relationships with close friends over sports to me
2/14/16, 9:36 PM - Belal Saleem: But only for special occasions
2/14/16, 9:36 PM - Belal Saleem: I'm giving you my opinion
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: LOL
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: BELAL
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shaham: 😂
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Belal Saleem: Not saying you were wrong, I wasn't there so I didn't have context, but for me, that's how I feel
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: "IM NOT TAKING SIDES, BUT I LIKE SHAHAM'S POINT"
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: I LOVE YOUUU
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Belal Saleem: K I pretty much took sides
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: ❤❤❤❤❤❤
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Belal Saleem: But really I didn't
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: 🇵🇰
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Belal Saleem: Just gave my opinion
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Shamil Khan: Btw
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Belal Saleem: Luv ya too ♥
2/14/16, 9:37 PM - Hammad Mirza: But anyways, no one knows the entire story, game ended at like 9:30, could have just chilled after but you left. Best thing to do would have been to do something before the game and after the game, I don't remember anything other than the game at the time

2/14/16, 9:38 PM - Hammad Mirza: Got pissed today because you made it sound like big games only get hyped up by unfaithful people.who get so engulfed in the hype that they forget everything about their lives and no one should ever get hyped about anything like a sporting event
2/14/16, 9:38 PM - Hammad Mirza: But atleast we got that cleared up

2/14/16, 9:40 PM - Shaham: I was pissed yes, and I still feel justified for that, and I feel I am right to be and no I don't understand your perspective. But now I'm not and its over but it has left me with a deep hatred for big games. But the fact I'm not pissed is not cause of you guys, its cause I chose to not be.

2/15/16, 12:26 PM - Shaham: Lol I actually was wondering that
2/15/16, 12:26 PM - Hammad Mirza: They made it to be such a big deal
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: Yeah idk :s
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Hammad Mirza: They're HYPING it so much they need to calm down
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Hammad Mirza: Jkjk 😂
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Hammad Mirza: @belal, explain
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: It's risky that's for sure
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: But not THAT
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: Risky
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Hammad Mirza: I think you have to kick it forwards
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: If ur players know about it
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Hammad Mirza: For it to be legal
2/15/16, 12:27 PM - Shaham: Mhmm
2/15/16, 12:28 PM - Hammad Mirza: Then you just have to beat the keeper and defenders
2/15/16, 12:28 PM - Shaham: Generally I would say penelty has a better chance of going in than that
2/15/16, 12:28 PM - Shaham: I think this was to give him that hattrick maybe?
2/15/16, 12:29 PM - Hammad Mirza: "THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SHAKESPEAREAN. BUT SHAKESPEARE GOT IT WRONG"

2/15/16, 12:32 PM - Belal Saleem: Lol
2/15/16, 12:32 PM - Belal Saleem: Its risky, that's why they don't try it
2/15/16, 12:32 PM - Belal Saleem: Much better chance if you just take the pen normally
2/15/16, 12:32 PM - Belal Saleem: But they were up 4-1 so why not
2/15/16, 2:41 PM - Qasim Malik: I just read some (not all) of last nights back and forth ^ I wanna get serious for a sec cause it seemed like a serious convo.

1) Belal totally took sides. If he wanted to be neutral, he shouldn't have said anything. The point he made about friendship > sports was an  obvious one which Hammad clearly never disagreed with it to begin with. Nah I'm not calling you out Belal, you just didn't see what the conflict really was. 

2) Shamil just kicked Hammad while he was down. That made Hammad even more defensive.

3) About us ditching you to watch a game, tbh I can't recall that night, but like Hammad said, it doesn't make sense to us why wouldn't have spent it with you considering it was your last night here. From what I remember, we did chill before you left. Having said that, I know I've pulled shit like this so I'm not shocked that this happened. I recognize the flaw, I just haven't been able to fix it. As for Hammad, I'm sure he feels bad about it, but I trust him enough to know it wasn't intentional. 

But Shaham, its totally understandable why you minded that, sounds real whack on our part. Maybe at the time we didn't realize what was happening, but I understand. I apologize for it and I'll try and make sure it doesn't happen again.
2/15/16, 2:41 PM - Qasim Malik: I know y'all already moved on from this talk but I thought I'd say some. its not awkward at all to talk like this sometimes 🙃
2/15/16, 2:45 PM - Shaham: <Media omitted>
2/15/16, 2:51 PM - Qasim Malik: You bastard. I pour my heart out and you give me that??
2/15/16, 2:59 PM - Hammad Mirza: LMAAOOOOO
2/15/16, 2:59 PM - Hammad Mirza: Perfect
2/15/16, 3:00 PM - Hammad Mirza: Thanks for writing that tho
2/15/16, 3:00 PM - Hammad Mirza: Didn't think you'd read it all
2/15/16, 3:01 PM - Shaham: I like #3
2/15/16, 3:03 PM - Shaham: I didn't think it was intentional. Y'all were just being suckish. Can't do anything about it now, just look towards the future. And also write your reflections *cough*
2/15/16, 3:23 PM - Mahmoud (NN): Wth did I miss?

And part of prophets mission was to be an example for us so by not exposing, he's actually teaching us how to behave as people who aren't prophets and can't tell who is what.

2/20/16, 9:44 PM - Shamil Khan: Just got back from Algonquin. Left at 4 AM after not sleeping at night. We got lost for 2 hours because the gates that the highway pointed to were closed for the winter. The gate that was open was through some hidden highway. Took us 6 hours to reach. But it was well worth it. Lots and lots of snow, Subhan Allah
2/20/16, 9:45 PM - Shamil Khan: We also almost died twice cause of the ice inside the park. Alhumdulillah Allah saved us. I'd still recommend it in the winter. It was beautiful

2/20/16, 11:02 PM - Shaham: ...it's shocking right?
2/20/16, 11:02 PM - Shaham: We've been brushing it off
2/20/16, 11:02 PM - Shaham: But...it's happening!
2/20/16, 11:04 PM - Hammad Mirza: Would he win against Sanders/clinton?
2/20/16, 11:05 PM - Belal Saleem: Shaykh hamza yusef said that (jokingly) if you want to wish bad in someone, wish that they live in interesting times

2/20/16, 11:36 PM - Hammad Mirza: So it'll be him vs either Bernie Sanders or Clinton in November
2/20/16, 11:36 PM - Shaham: Oh man I'd like to see that showdown tho
